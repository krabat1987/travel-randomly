travel-randomly
===============

The idea is, that not you decide where to go on vacation, but a die does that
for you on the fly. It is a game, that can bring you literally everywhere. You
just have to engage yourself with the rules.

Best played with a car, motorcycle or anything else, that has a motor, so you
don't travel forever. The rules are aimed for traveling with a car or
motorcycle. Feel free to adapt them to bicycles or hiking.

Rules
=====

0. Every type of road is permitted, but the following:

   - the highway (Autobahn). This type of road is really the only one you may
     ONLY use to go back home or in emergencies!
   - dirt roads or field paths (except getting to the place where you want to
     sleep for the night)
   - every other untarred path or road.

   You may use field paths to go to an interesting sight or so, but make sure
   you go on car friendly roads most of the time traveling.

1. Every morning when you start traveling, you roll a die (D20) to determine
   which approximate direction - north, south, west or east - you should go for
   the first X kilometers (where X is between 10 and 200).

   On a standard D20 the directions are coded as
   - north: 1 - 5
   - east:  6 - 10
   - south: 11 - 15
   - west:  16 - 20

   To determine your X roll the D20 die and multiply the number by 10.

   Adapt them to your needs when using other dice, but make sure you get equal
   intervals.

   After the first X kilometers, apply rules 2 and further. If you come to an
   intersection and can't go straight on, roll a D6 die and exceptionally apply
   rule 2.

2. On every intersection you roll a normal D6 die and apply the following
   computation advices.

   For an intersection
   - with two possibilities go left for an even number and right for an odd
     number.
   - with three possibilities calculate the modulo of the number your die shows.
     For
     - a 0 go left
     - a 1 go straight ahead
     - a 2 go right

   When you approach a roundabout roll the D6 die and take the Xth exit, where X
   is the number you rolled on your die modulo the number of exits and 0 is the
   first exit, 1 the second and so on.

   IMPORTANT: You are NEVER allowed to go back from where you came!

3. When you approach a city, not (small) village, you flip a coin. Head you go
   to the city, tail you try to avoid the city. No buts. Villages are always
   visited. Also no buts. Within cities rule 2 is not applied. Go sightseeing!

4. Make sure you know where you stay the night by 6 p.m.

5. Stay inquisitive!
